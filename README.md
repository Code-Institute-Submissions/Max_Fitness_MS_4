 ### Strategy plane:

 #### As a Developer

- [x] I aim to build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain. 
- [x] The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each potentially reusable component in your project
- [x] Design a relational database schema well-suited for my domain. Put some thought into the relationships between entities.
- [x] Create at least 2 custom django models beyond the examples shown on the course.
- [x] User Authentication: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in.
- [x] Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend.
- [x] At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe.
- [x] Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout 
- [x] The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience.
- [x] Use Git & GitHub for version control.
- [x] Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources.
- [x] Deploy the final version of my code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.

## Features

### Testing Deployment
- All of the code written was tested and re-tested.
- Defensive Design was tested by manually adding URL endpoints.
- Login system was tested using bogus emails and passwords.
- Sign-up system was tested using same emails.
- Login system was tested using correct emails and passwords.
- Sign-up system was tested using different emails.
- Search bar was tested by: using bogus input values, searching for the value that does not exist in the database, searching for the value that exists, inputting symbols, and numbers.

Here is the list of all manually tested user stories:

1. Page anchor tags:
    1. Go to the "Home" page.
    2. Try to click on the brand logo "Max Fitness'' found in the top left corner it should reload the page.

2. Navigation bar:
    1. Go to the "Home" page. 
    2. Try to downsize the browser window, at one point navigation links should collapse into hamburger icons.
    3. Try to click the hamburger icon, it should open a mobile navigation menu.
    4. Try to increase browser window size while nav is open, at one point links should go back to their initial positions.
    
3. Product app search button:
    1. Go to the "Home" page.
    2. Try to click on the input field, enter any value. 
    3. Try to click search button on the right side of input field, it should redirect you to the "product" page showing you the results of your search. 
    3. Try to repeat the process using different values or empty fields.

4. Checkout page input fields:
    1. Go to the "Bag" page.
    2. Try to click the "Secure Checkout" button, checkout page should open now displaying form inputs including the Stripe card input.

    1. Go to the "Blog" page.
    2. Click "Read More" button on one of the posts.
    3. Try to submit an empty field as comment. 

Using the Bootstrap layout, and mobile fist development method, it allowed me to create a responsive website. All of the content resizes appropriately to the size of the displayed screen.
This was tested using Google's Inspect Tool that allowed me to resize the screen and see how my website responds to different device screen sizes. 

- HTML was validated using [validator.w3](https://validator.w3.org/).
- I used HTML of deployed website inside the validator, so that I can bypass the templating syntax.
- CSS was validated with [jigsaw.w3](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- CSS vendor prefixes were added using [autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/).
- JavaScript was validated with [jshint.com](https://jshint.com/).
- Python syntax was checked using [pep8online.com](http://pep8online.com/).
- All of the code was formated.

## Deployment

For this project, I used [Github](https://github.com/) platform, where I created [repository](https://github.com/Manojlovic1998/Max_Fitness_MS_4) using a template provided to me by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
Once the repository was created, I have used browser IDE addon for GitHub called [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/), to open the repository.
This online IDE that allowed me to access repository as, ["Gitpod knows where you are coming from and beams you into the right context."](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki?hl=en).
Using this IDE I was able to make my commits and push all of my code to the [Github](https://github.com/). After project was complited it was hosted and deployed through [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

- Deployment step by step process:
1. Go to [repository](https://github.com/Manojlovic1998/Max_Fitness_MS_4).
2. Open [repository](https://github.com/Manojlovic1998/Max_Fitness_MS_4) using [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) IDE.
3. In terminal run "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt" command to create a .txt file with all of the dependencies used that [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) needs to know what dependencies app uses.
4. In the terminal run the "echo web: python app.py > Procfile" command to create Procfile that [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) needs to know what file runs the app.
5. Check the files that you have created, if Procfile has a blank line under the first line, delete the blank line.
6. Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and log in.
7. Once logged in, and in your dashboard, click on "Create New App".
8. Under "Create New App" click on the input field called "App Name".
9. Give your app a unique name using a dash or minus instead of spaces.
10. Select the region closes to your location.
11. Click "create app".
12. To connect the app, we are gonna set up automatic deployment by clicking on the "Github" icon inside of the "Deployment Method" section.
13. Under the "Deployment Method" section there will be a new section called "Connect to GitHub", make sure that your GitHub profile is displayed inside it.
14. Insert repo-name inside the "Connect to Github" section input. This input can be found to the right of where your profile is displayed.
15. Click Search.
16. Once it finds your repo, click the "connect" button.
17. Before clicking the "Enable Automatic Deployment" button, click on the settings tab in the top part of the page.
18. Click on "Reveal Config Var".
19. Here you can tell Heroku which variables are required, do not include quotes for the key or the value.
20. Variables inserted (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WH_SECRET, USE_AWS).
21. Go back to GitPod IDE and make sure that you have pushed your requirements.txt and Procfile to the repo.
22. Head back to Heroku and click on "Enable Automatic Deployment".
23. Select your branch. Branch selected (master).
24. Click "Deploy Branch"
25. It will take some time for Heroku to build the app.
26. Once the site is deployed click "View" to launch the new app.

- Local Deployment:
 1. To run the code locally you can go to [Github repository](https://github.com/Manojlovic1998/Max_Fitness_MS_4)).
 2. There you can download a zip file that includes all of the files used to create this website. 
 3. Once you have downloaded the files you can use IDE such as [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to open them.
 4. From there you use any addon that allows you to run the server locally. 
 5. In order to have a functional app, you will have to load the json data from fixtures.

## Information Architecture

- The data structure of different data models and their relations look like this:

### Notes:
- These are some notes worth mentioning to whoever gets to review my code:
    - I will use all of the apps that I have currently built in my future projects as I plan to extend them and make them better. This will allow me to have a set of plugin apps ready to go each time I have to make some new project for someone.  
    - In terms of UI design I have strayed a bit from my main wireframe. The reason for this is time was a limiting factor here. I decided to keep things simple and in future versions, I will add everything else as I will not be limited by the deadline.

### Content

- The **text content** of the one blog post presented on the website is not my creation. Websites is created solely for educational purposes to showcase my programing logic.
It will not be used for any commercial benefits only for educational purposes.
